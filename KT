Here is a **comprehensive beginner-to-pro-level guide** on what you should **ask, understand, and document** during your **Cypress Automation project KT (Knowledge Transfer)** — especially when pipelines and servers are involved.

---

## 🧠 I. CORE TOPICS TO UNDERSTAND DURING KT

### 🔹 1. **Project Overview**

Ask:

* What is the **goal** of this automation?
* What is the **application under test (AUT)**?
* What types of tests are automated? (Smoke, Regression, E2E, etc.)
* How often are tests run? (Daily? Per build?)

---

### 🔹 2. **Cypress Framework Structure**

Ask or check:

* Where is the **Cypress test code** located?

  * Typical folders: `/cypress/integration/`, `/cypress/support/`
* Are we using **TypeScript or JavaScript**?
* What are the **naming conventions** for test files?
* How are tests grouped? (Feature-wise, module-wise, tag-based?)

✅ **Best Practice:** Keep tests modular and use Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability.

---

### 🔹 3. **Environment & Configuration**

Ask:

* How are test environments managed? (dev, QA, staging, prod)
* Are **.env** files or `cypress.config.js` used for variables?
* Is there **dynamic base URL switching**?

✅ **Best Practice:** Never hardcode environment-specific values — use config or environment variables.

---

### 🔹 4. **Test Data Management**

Ask:

* How is test data generated or cleaned up?
* Do we use **fixtures**, mocks, or **live data**?
* Is there a **backend reset** mechanism before/after tests?

✅ **Best Practice:** Use **fixtures** or API setup calls to ensure clean test states.

---

### 🔹 5. **Authentication & Authorization**

Ask:

* Is login handled via **UI** or **API token**?
* Is **session caching** used to skip login in repeated tests?

✅ **Best Practice:** Prefer **API-based login** with `cy.request()` for faster test setup.

---

### 🔹 6. **Custom Commands**

Ask:

* What **custom Cypress commands** are defined in `/cypress/support/commands.js`?
* How to use them? Are they documented?

✅ **Best Practice:** Abstract repetitive tasks into custom commands.

---

### 🔹 7. **CI/CD Integration (Pipelines)**

Ask:

* Which tool is used for pipelines? (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, etc.)
* When do tests run? (on pull request, nightly, release?)
* Where is the pipeline YAML/config file?
* Are artifacts like screenshots/videos uploaded?
* Is parallelization used for speed?

✅ **Best Practice:** Run smoke tests on every pull request, and full suite on nightly or release branches.

---

### 🔹 8. **Reporting & Results**

Ask:

* How are test results reported? (HTML, JUnit, Allure, Dashboard?)
* Where are the test reports stored or emailed?
* Are **screenshots/videos** enabled for failed tests?

✅ **Best Practice:** Integrate dashboards like Cypress Dashboard or Allure for visual feedback.

---

### 🔹 9. **Server & Infrastructure**

Ask:

* Where are the tests running? Local, Docker, cloud server?
* Are tests containerized (Docker)?
* Is there a dedicated **test runner machine**?
* How are browsers managed in pipeline (Chrome headless, Electron, etc.)?

✅ **Best Practice:** Use Docker + Cypress base image for stable test runs across environments.

---

### 🔹 10. **Maintenance & Scalability**

Ask:

* How are flaky tests tracked and fixed?
* Is there a backlog for test automation?
* How to write new tests and add to CI?
* Who reviews test code? Is there a review checklist?

✅ **Best Practice:** Treat test automation code like production code — follow linting, versioning, and review practices.

---

## 🗂️ II. QUESTIONS TO ASK DURING KT

### 🔧 Technical

* How is Cypress configured? Where is `cypress.config.js` or `cypress.json`?
* What are the key utility/helper files?
* How is login handled?
* How are API calls mocked, if any?
* What are the critical test flows? (Happy path, edge cases, etc.)
* Are there reusable components or test IDs?

### 🚀 DevOps / Pipelines

* What pipeline tool is used?
* How is test failure handled in CI?
* Are pipelines blocking merges?
* How are tests scheduled?
* Where are YAML/config files?

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Team & Process

* Who is the automation POC (Point of Contact)?
* Is there documentation for writing new tests?
* How are test cases reviewed?
* How are bugs reported from automation?

## 🔒 III. BEST PRACTICES CHECKLIST ✅

| Category        | Best Practice                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Structure       | Follow Page Object Model (POM)                   |
| Configuration   | Use `cypress.config.ts` and `.env` properly      |
| Data            | Keep fixtures clean and versioned                |
| Commands        | Add reusable logic in `commands.ts`              |
| Assertions      | Keep them specific and descriptive               |
| Logging         | Use `cy.log()` for visibility                    |
| Debugging       | Use `.debug()` and `--headed` mode               |
| Parallelization | Split tests in pipeline to reduce execution time |
| Reporting       | Integrate with Cypress Dashboard or Allure       |
| Maintenance     | Track flaky tests; document test ownership       |

## 📘 What to Document for Future

* Folder and file structure of the Cypress framework
* Custom command list and usage
* Authentication logic
* Test execution steps (local + CI)
* Common debugging commands
* How to add a new test
* How to trigger tests from pipeline
* Screenshot/video path
* Contact list for test failures

Would you like me to generate:

* ✅ A **PDF checklist**
* ✅ A **sample `cypress.config.ts`**
* ✅ A **template test file with custom login**
* ✅ A **CI pipeline YAML file**
* ✅ A **real interview Q\&A based on this**

Let me know and I’ll build it for you in your format (PDF, DOCX, CSV, etc.) with visuals and real code.
