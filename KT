Here is a **comprehensive beginner-to-pro-level guide** on what you should **ask, understand, and document** during your **Cypress Automation project KT (Knowledge Transfer)** — especially when pipelines and servers are involved.

---

## 🧠 I. CORE TOPICS TO UNDERSTAND DURING KT

### 🔹 1. **Project Overview**

Ask:

* What is the **goal** of this automation?
* What is the **application under test (AUT)**?
* What types of tests are automated? (Smoke, Regression, E2E, etc.)
* How often are tests run? (Daily? Per build?)

---

### 🔹 2. **Cypress Framework Structure**

Ask or check:

* Where is the **Cypress test code** located?

  * Typical folders: `/cypress/integration/`, `/cypress/support/`
* Are we using **TypeScript or JavaScript**?
* What are the **naming conventions** for test files?
* How are tests grouped? (Feature-wise, module-wise, tag-based?)

✅ **Best Practice:** Keep tests modular and use Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability.

---

### 🔹 3. **Environment & Configuration**

Ask:

* How are test environments managed? (dev, QA, staging, prod)
* Are **.env** files or `cypress.config.js` used for variables?
* Is there **dynamic base URL switching**?

✅ **Best Practice:** Never hardcode environment-specific values — use config or environment variables.

---

### 🔹 4. **Test Data Management**

Ask:

* How is test data generated or cleaned up?
* Do we use **fixtures**, mocks, or **live data**?
* Is there a **backend reset** mechanism before/after tests?

✅ **Best Practice:** Use **fixtures** or API setup calls to ensure clean test states.

---

### 🔹 5. **Authentication & Authorization**

Ask:

* Is login handled via **UI** or **API token**?
* Is **session caching** used to skip login in repeated tests?

✅ **Best Practice:** Prefer **API-based login** with `cy.request()` for faster test setup.

---

### 🔹 6. **Custom Commands**

Ask:

* What **custom Cypress commands** are defined in `/cypress/support/commands.js`?
* How to use them? Are they documented?

✅ **Best Practice:** Abstract repetitive tasks into custom commands.

---

### 🔹 7. **CI/CD Integration (Pipelines)**

Ask:

* Which tool is used for pipelines? (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, etc.)
* When do tests run? (on pull request, nightly, release?)
* Where is the pipeline YAML/config file?
* Are artifacts like screenshots/videos uploaded?
* Is parallelization used for speed?

✅ **Best Practice:** Run smoke tests on every pull request, and full suite on nightly or release branches.

---

### 🔹 8. **Reporting & Results**

Ask:

* How are test results reported? (HTML, JUnit, Allure, Dashboard?)
* Where are the test reports stored or emailed?
* Are **screenshots/videos** enabled for failed tests?

✅ **Best Practice:** Integrate dashboards like Cypress Dashboard or Allure for visual feedback.

---

### 🔹 9. **Server & Infrastructure**

Ask:

* Where are the tests running? Local, Docker, cloud server?
* Are tests containerized (Docker)?
* Is there a dedicated **test runner machine**?
* How are browsers managed in pipeline (Chrome headless, Electron, etc.)?

✅ **Best Practice:** Use Docker + Cypress base image for stable test runs across environments.

---

### 🔹 10. **Maintenance & Scalability**

Ask:

* How are flaky tests tracked and fixed?
* Is there a backlog for test automation?
* How to write new tests and add to CI?
* Who reviews test code? Is there a review checklist?

✅ **Best Practice:** Treat test automation code like production code — follow linting, versioning, and review practices.

---

## 🗂️ II. QUESTIONS TO ASK DURING KT

### 🔧 Technical

* How is Cypress configured? Where is `cypress.config.js` or `cypress.json`?
* What are the key utility/helper files?
* How is login handled?
* How are API calls mocked, if any?
* What are the critical test flows? (Happy path, edge cases, etc.)
* Are there reusable components or test IDs?

### 🚀 DevOps / Pipelines

* What pipeline tool is used?
* How is test failure handled in CI?
* Are pipelines blocking merges?
* How are tests scheduled?
* Where are YAML/config files?

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Team & Process

* Who is the automation POC (Point of Contact)?
* Is there documentation for writing new tests?
* How are test cases reviewed?
* How are bugs reported from automation?

You're in a **Knowledge Transfer (KT)** phase at your new company, and it's common to feel overwhelmed—especially when the team isn’t providing enough structured guidance. But don't worry. I’ll give you **a step-by-step survival and mastery strategy** with clear **tips, valid questions, big-picture understanding, and specific tactics** to extract knowledge even from an unhelpful team.

---

## 🔥 1. **Your KT Survival Mindset**

You are not a passive receiver. You are:

* 📡 **An investigator** (gather evidence and connections)
* 🧱 **A builder** (reconstruct the system mentally)
* 🧭 **A cartographer** (draw the complete map of systems, data flows, and responsibilities)
* 📋 **A documenter** (leave behind better documentation than what you got)

---

## 🧠 2. **What You Need to Understand (Big Picture)**

| Area                                   | Description                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 **End-to-End Workflow**             | What is the purpose of the entire system? Where does data come from? What happens to it? Where does it go? |
| 📦 **Modules or Components**           | What are the main systems or microservices? E.g., ingestion, processing, reporting.                        |
| 📅 **Daily, Weekly Jobs**              | Which pipelines or automations run daily/weekly/monthly? What happens when they fail?                      |
| 👥 **Who owns what?**                  | Who are the key SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) for each part of the system?                                 |
| 🔐 **Access/Permissions**              | What do you need access to? Who approves it?                                                               |
| 🚨 **Monitoring/Alerts**               | How is the system monitored? Is there PagerDuty/XMatters/Control-M/Alerts?                                 |
| 📄 **Documentation (or lack thereof)** | Where is current documentation stored? Wiki? SharePoint? Notion? Is it outdated?                           |

---

## ✅ 3. **Before Every KT Session – Prepare Like This**

1. **Send a Clear Calendar Invite**
   Title: `"KT: <Module Name> Overview"`
   Description:

   > “Please walk me through the following:
   >
   > * What this module/system does
   > * Where the code/config is
   > * Common issues
   > * How to debug
   > * Who to contact if I get stuck
   > * Any best practices
   >   Thanks!”

2. **Have This KT Template Ready to Fill**

   ```
   Module/System Name:
   Purpose:
   Input/Output:
   Source Code Location:
   Data Flow Steps:
   Common Issues:

## ❓ 4. **Critical Questions to Ask During KT**

### 🔍 For Any Module / Component:

* **What is the business purpose of this module?**
* **Where is the source code/config stored? Git repo? Path?**
* **What are the input data sources and output targets?**
* **What schedule does it run on (daily/hourly/manual)?**
* **What happens if it fails? How do we know?**
* **How do we re-run or backfill it?**
* **What are the most common issues seen here?**
* **Who are the current owners/SMEs of this system?**
* **Is there any documentation available?**

### 🧪 For Pipelines / Automation:

* **Where is the orchestration handled (Control-M, ADF, Airflow, etc.)?**
* **Which step is the most fragile?**
* **How do we validate successful execution?**
* **How are secrets and credentials handled? (KeyVault, Env variables?)**

### ⚙️ For Code & Configuration:

* **How do we deploy changes? (Manual/CI/CD pipeline?)**
* **Are there any test environments? How do we test safely?**
* **Where can I see logs (Databricks UI, Splunk, App Insights, etc.)?**
* **What naming conventions should I follow?**

## 🧱 5. **Build a KT Tracker Document**

| Date   | Topic              | Owner | Systems Covered    | Notes                 | Action Items                 |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Jun 10 | Ingestion Pipeline | John  | Kafka, Spark       | \[Link to notes]      | Set up access, test pipeline |
| Jun 11 | Reporting          | Priya | Power BI           | Missing credentials   | Request Power BI role        |
| Jun 12 | Data Lake Zones    | Raj   | Bronze/Silver/Gold | Understand zone logic | Schedule session             |

Maintain this tracker as your personal and team KT dashboard.

## 🛠️ 6. **Tactics for Passive or Poor KT Givers**

* **Share a Google Doc and type in real-time** during KT — they will correct mistakes out of habit
* **Ask "Can I share my screen and you guide me?"** — forces them to explain clearly
* **Say "Let’s record the session for my notes"** — even if they don’t explain well, you can replay and reverse-engineer later
* **Shadow a Run**: Ask to **sit in a meeting or monitoring session** silently just to observe real work
* **"Can you walk me through this ticket/story from JIRA/ADO?"** — best way to learn a real example

---

## 🔁 7. **After KT – How to Maximize Learning**

* Summarize what you learned and send it to them for correction:

  > “Here’s what I understood:
  >
  > 1. This module ingests data from X via Kafka
  > 2. It processes using Spark
  > 3. It fails when partition schema mismatches
  >    Please confirm or correct.”

* Make mind maps or flowcharts from your notes to visualize it.

---

## 📊 8. **Make Your Own KT Dashboard in Notion / Excel / Markdown**

Example structure:

```
# KT Dashboard

## Module: IngestionPipeline
- Input: Oracle CDC (via GoldenGate)
- Transport: Kafka Topic `cdc_user_activity`
- Transformation: Spark Structured Streaming job
- Output: Bronze table in Delta Lake
- Git Repo: `ingestion-pipeline-repo`
- Trigger: ADF scheduled pipeline
- Owner: john.doe@company.com
```

---

## 🎯 9. **Final Tips**

* ✨ **Always end the KT with “What should I explore next?”**
* 🧠 **Ask to do reverse KT**: "Can I explain what I learned tomorrow and you correct me?"
* 🔑 **Keep asking "Why is this done this way?"** – this reveals 90% of tribal knowledge
* 🧩 **Cross-map systems**: See how ingestion, storage, reporting, monitoring are all tied together

---

## 🧭 10. **Ultimate Goal**

When KT ends, you should:

* Know **who owns what**, **where the code lives**, and **how things move**
* Be able to **draw the flow from source to dashboard**
* Know **where to look when something breaks**
* Be ready to take full ownership of at least **one module or task**

---

If you want, I can also:

* ✅ Generate a **custom KT dashboard template** for Notion, Excel, or Markdown
* ✅ Help you build a **system flowchart** for what you’ve learned so far
* ✅ Help with **follow-up email drafts** or **access request messages**

Would you like any of these right now?
